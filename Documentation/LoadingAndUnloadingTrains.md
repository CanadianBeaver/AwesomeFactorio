# Loading and Unloading Trains

For quick loading or unloading the trains always use intermediate `Iron chest` or `Steel chest` between `Cargo wagon` and `Belt`. For loading or unloading liquids use `Storage tank` between the `Pump` and `Pipes`.
In this case, chests and tanks act as a [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)){:target="_blank"} when moving items and liquids between trains.

You can place up to 6 `inserters` on each side of the cargo wagon, maximum 12 inserters on both sides. You can also place up to 3 pumps on each side of the `fluid wagon`, maximum 6. But such a number of pumps is not rational, two pumps per fluid wagon are enough.
